## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to build an app using node.js, inquirer, and mysql that will store employee data. The app should allow the user to create and manage employee data from the command line.

## Description
The app will begin when the uset enters the node index.js command in the command line. Then the user is presented with a list of options. The user can use the down arrow key to toggle through the list of options. When the user selects view all departments, roles, or employees then a table is logged to the console containig the selected data. The user also has the option to add a new department, role, or employee. For each option the user is promted to input the needed date for creation of the selection. The next option allows the user to update an employee's role by selecting from the list of employees presented in the question prompt. The user is then prompted to enter the employee's new role id number. However, this is where I fell short on this challenge. The correct information is logging to the console when entered but an undefined is presented and the employee is not updated. The final option is to finish the build which restarts the terminal when selected.

## Lessons

The most challenging part of this challenge for me was the update route. I had my assignment completed on time except fot the update route. I tinkered and researched for a week to get it working but i finally decided to throw in the towel so I could get the assignment turned in. I know my route is correct so my error has to be in how I feed the data into the route. I will keep working on this untill i figure it out. The second main lesson for me on this project was the file structure. I was originally convinced I needed a server.js file because we had recently been working with express. But I didn't understand how this would work with the app. So, when I met with my tutor he explained my error and then file structure made more sense.
